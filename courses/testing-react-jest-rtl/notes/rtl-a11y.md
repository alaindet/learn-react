# React Testing Library and Accessibility

- By default, RTL suggests to query elements in the DOM by accessibility priorities, meaning by role, then by label, by placeholder, by alt text etc
- The last resort should be querying the DOM by element tag, class and ID
- Reference https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#role_definitions
